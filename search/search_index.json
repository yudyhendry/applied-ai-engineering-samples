When combined with the Kubernetes Kueue job queuing API, it provides flexible and comprehensive training job orchestration.</p> <p>The training environment's Kueue configuration  consists of a single ClusterQueue and multiple LocalQueues. This topology provides basic multi-tenancy and supports managing and prioritizing jobs submitted by multiple teams.</p> <p>All training workloads are represented as JobSet resources. A JobSet resource may contain multiple job types, such as a core distributed training job and an auxiliary job that manages TensorBoard logs and other artifacts generated by the training job.</p> <p>JobSet workloads are submitted to a namespaced LocalQueue that points to a ClusterQueue. As illustrated in the diagram, in our reference implementation, there is a single cluster queue.</p> <p>Kueue monitors when resources (such as TPU slices) required by a workload (JobSet) are available, and then decides when to admit the workload and how to allocate the workload's components to the cluster's node pools. </p> <p>For example, a training workload can contain two types of jobs: - A multislice distributed training job - A job that uploads TensorBoard logs generated by the training job to Vertex AI TensorBoard</p> <p>When all the resources required by this workload become available, the training job's workers are started on the requested number of TPU slices. The TensorBoard uploader is started on one of the nodes in the CPU node pool.</p> <p>If the compute resources required by other submitted workloads are not available, these workloads are queued and scheduled for admission based on the priorities that have been defined in the Kueue configuration.</p> <p>To submit a JobSet-defined workload, you need to create a YAML JobSet resource definition. There are a few different ways to do this. In this guide, we demonstrate two approaches: - Using Kustomize, which helps you create YAML JobSet resource definitions directly. - Using  xpk, which provides an easy-to-use Python-based CLI.</p>"},{"location":"ai-infrastructure/tpu-training-on-gke/#setup","title":"Setup","text":"<p>The deployment process is automated using Cloud Build, Terraform, and Kustomize.

training environment as outlined in the environment setup. In this reference guide  we recommend using the JobSet and Kueue APIs as the preferred way to orchestrate large-scale distributed training workloads on GKE. You can create JobSet yaml configurations in a variety of ways. Our examples demonstrate two approaches: - Using Kustomize. Kustomize is a tool that streamlines and simplifies the creation and adaptation of complex configurations like JobSets. It provides robust configuration management and template-free customization. The examples of creating JobSet configurations using Kustomize are in the jobset folder. - Using xpk. xpk (Accelerated Processing Kit) is a Python-based tool that helps to orchestrate large-scale training jobs on GKE. xpk provides a simple command-line interface for managing GKE clusters and submitting training workloads that are encapsulated as JobSet configurations. In this reference guide, we do not use cluster management capabilities. We use xpk to configure and submit training workloads to the GKE-based training environment provisioned during the setup. The xpk examples are in the xpk folder.</p> <p>The examples are all based on the MaxText code base. MaxText is a high-performance, highly scalable, open-source LLM code base written in pure Python/Jax. It is optimized for Google Cloud TPUs and can achieve 55% to 60% MFU (model flops utilization). MaxText is designed to be a launching point for ambitious LLM projects in both research and production.

Then I need to compare that number to the actual sale count value for that item. The phone with the biggest difference between the sale count field and the inventory differences is the most unaccounted for. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra had 100 in stock Aug 1 and 80 in stock Sep 1. 100 minus 80 is 20 (100 - 80 = 20). Sale count is 19. 20 minus 19 is 1 (20 - 19 = 1). 1 unit is unaccounted for. Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus had 50 in stock Aug 1 and 40 in stock Sep 1. 50 minus 40 is 10 (50 - 40 = 10). Sale count is 10. The sale count matches the inventory difference, no units are unaccounted for. Samsung Galaxy S22 had 25 in stock Aug 1 and 20 in stock Sep 1. 25 minus 20 is 5 (25 - 20 = 5). Sale count is 5. 20 minus 19 is 1. The sale count matches the inventory difference, no units are unaccounted for. Only the S22 Ultra had anything unaccounted for. The answer is Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.

Answer: I need to look at the vendors one by one. I have to deduce the vendors from the Item Name field. There are three unique vendors in the table: Apple, Samsung, and Google. For each vendor, I need to find the sale count for each item one by one, then add up the sales counts. The Apple items are the iPhone 13 Pro Max with 17 sales, the iPhone 13 Pro with 9 sales, and the iPhone 13 with 4 sales. 17 + 9 + 4 = 30. 30 Apple phones were sold. The Samsung items are the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra with 19 sales, the Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus with 10 sales, and the Samsung Galaxy S22 with 5 sales. 19 + 10 + 5 = 34. 34 Samsung phones were sold. The Google item is the Google Pixel 6 Pro with 20 sales. 20 Google phones were sold. 30 Apple, 34 Samsung, 20 Google. 34 is the biggest number, it is for Samsung sales. The answer is Samsung.

Answer: I need to look at each item one by one. The iPhone 13 Pro Max had 17 sales. The iPhone 13 Pro had 9 sales. The iPhone 13 had 4 sales. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra had 19 sales. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus had 10 sales. The Samsung Galaxy S22 had 5 sales. The Google Pixel 6 Pro had 20 sales.

The answer is the Google Pixel 6 Pro.  \"\"\"  # Prepending the few shot exemplars before the question we want answered. llm_call = f\"{context}\\n{few_shot_exemplar}{question}\\nAnswer:\" _ = call_llm(model, parameters, llm_call) <pre>The call to the LLM:\nAnswer questions about a table.\nAll questions must be supported by facts in the table.\nAll reasoning must be done step by step.\nExplain the reasoning.\nWhen looking at multiple rows, explain the reasoning for each row one by one.\n\n\nTable:\n| Item Name | SKU | Vendor | Aug 1 Inventory | Sep 1 Inventory | Sale Count |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| iPhone 13 Pro Max | MGL83LL/A | Apple | 100 | 80 | 17 |\n| iPhone 13 Pro | MLL03LL/A | Apple | 50 | 40 | 9 |\n| iPhone 13 | MLKG3LL/A | Apple | 25 | 20 | 4 |\n| Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra | SM-S908U | Samsung | 100 | 80 | 19 |\n| Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus | SM-S906U | Samsung | 50 | 40 | 10 |\n| Samsung Galaxy S22 | SM-S901U | Samsung | 25 | 20 | 5 |\n| Google Pixel 6 Pro | GA01314-US | Google | 100 | 80 | 20 |\n\nQuestion:\nWhat iPhone sold the most in August?\nAnswer: I need to look at each item one by one and determine if it is an iPhone.\nOnly iPhone items are considered.\nThe iPhone items are the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the iPhone 13 Pro, and the iPhone 13.\nI need to look at how much each iPhone sold one by one, and then see which sold count is the highest.\niPhone 13 Pro Max sale count is 17.\niPhone 13 Pro sale count is 9.\niPhone 13 sale count is 4.\nThe biggest number of 17, 9, and 4 is 17.\nThe answer is iPhone 13 Pro Max.\n\nTable:\n| Item Name | SKU | Vendor | Aug 1 Inventory | Sep 1 Inventory | Sale Count |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| iPhone 13 Pro Max | MGL83LL/A | Apple | 100 | 80 | 17 |\n| iPhone 13 Pro | MLL03LL/A | Apple | 50 | 40 | 9 |\n| iPhone 13 | MLKG3LL/A | Apple | 25 | 20 | 4 |\n| Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra | SM-S908U | Samsung | 100 | 80 | 19 |\n| Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus | SM-S906U | Samsung | 50 | 40 | 10 |\n| Samsung Galaxy S22 | SM-S901U | Samsung | 25 | 20 | 5 |\n| Google Pixel 6 Pro | GA01314-US | Google | 100 | 80 | 20 |\n\nQuestion:\nWhat Samsung phone has the most units unaccounted for on Sep 1?\nAnswer: I need to look at each item one by one and determine if it is a Samsung item.\nI have to look at the Item Name for Samsung items.\nOnly Samsung items are considered.\nThe Samsung items are the S22 Ultra, the S22 Plus, and the S22.\nOne by one, I need to look at the Sep 1 and Aug 1 inventory difference for each Samsung item to see how many units should have been sold.\nThen I need to compare that number to the actual sale count value for that item.\nThe phone with the biggest difference between the sale count field and the inventory differences is the most unaccounted for.\nSamsung Galaxy S22 Ultra had 100 in stock Aug 1 and 80 in stock Sep 1. 100 minus 80 is 20 (100 - 80 = 20).

It was a great sensation at the time, and caused a \"storm of outraged controversy\" that went beyond the theatre to the world of newspapers and society.In 2006, the centennial of Ibsen's death, A Doll's House held the distinction of being the world's most performed play that year. UNESCO has inscribed Ibsen's autographed manuscripts of A Doll's House on the Memory of the World Register in 2001, in recognition of their historical value.The title of \nThought 2: Ibsen's 'A Doll's House' premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The theatre was founded in 1748, first serving as the theatre of the king, and then as the theatre of the country. The theatre presents opera, the Royal Danish Ballet, multi-genre concerts, and drama in several locations. The Royal Danish Theatre organization is under the control of the Danish Ministry of Culture.\n\n\n== Performing arts venues ==\nThe Old Stage is the original Royal Danish Theatre built in 1874.\nThe Copenhagen Opera House (Operaen), built in 2004.\nSt\u00e6rekassen (New Stage) is an Art Deco theatre adjacent to the main theatre. It was used for drama productions. It is no longer used by the Royal Theatre.\nThe Royal Danish Playhouse is a venue for \"spoken theatre\" with three stages, inaugurated in 2008.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe Royal Theatre on Kongens\nThought 3:\n\nThe response:\nThe Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark was founded in 1748.

It is generally regarded as the first mass-affordable automobile, which made car travel available to middle-class Americans. The relatively low price was partly the result of Ford's efficient fabrication, including assembly line production instead of individual handcrafting. It was mainly designed by three engineers, Joseph A. Galamb (the main engineer), Eugene Farkas, and Childe Harold Wills. The Model T was colloquially known as the \"Tin Lizzie\".The Ford Model T was named the most influential car of the 20th century in the 1999 Car of the Century competition, ahead of the BMC Mini, Citro\u00ebn DS, and Volkswagen Beetle.

Its central character, psychology professor Peter Boyd (Reagan), tries to teach human morals to a chimpanzee, hoping to solve the \"nature versus nurture\" question. Boyd hires Jane Linden (Lynn) to pose as the chimpanzee's mother while he plays father to it and uses 1950s-era child-rearing techniques.A sequel was released titled Bonzo Goes to College (1952), but it featured none of the three lead performers from the original film. Peggy, who had also appeared in My Friend Irma Goes West (1950), died in a fire on March 4, 1951, so another chimpanzee was hired for the second film. Reagan did not want to appear in the second film as he thought that the premise was unbelievable.\n\n\n\nPage: Bedtime for Democracy\nSummary: Bedtime for Democracy is the fourth and final studio album by American punk rock band Dead Kennedys. Released in 1986, songs on this album cover common punk subjects often found in punk rock lyrics of the era such as conformity, Reaganomics, the U.S. military, and critique of the hardcore punk movement. The album's title refers to the 1951 comedy film, Bedtime for Bonzo starring Ronald Reagan and also reflects the band's weary bitterness from the trial they were undergoing at the time over the controversial art included with their previous album. By the time recording of Bedtime for Democracy had begun, the Dead Kennedys had already played what would be their last concert with Jello Biafra and announced their breakup immediately after the release of the record, whose opening track is a cover of David Allan Coe's \"Take This Job and Shove It.\"\n\n\nThought:I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: Ronald Reagan\n\n&gt;

Exposes details available at callback time to each executed step in a chain.    Method arguments in this class are based on the (most of?) the arguments     available to the callback method, though not all implementations in this     class use all the arguments.    Usage:     Pass as an argument to a langchain method or class that accepts a callback       handler. Note that  not all langchain classes will invoke all callbacks       when the callback handler is provided at initialization time, so the       recommended usage is to provide the callback handler when executing a       chain.    Example:     from langchain import LLMChain, PromptTemplate     from langchain.llms import VertexAI     import vertexai  # Comes from google-cloud-aiplatform package.     vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=REGION)      llm = VertexAI(temperature=0)  # Use any LLM.     prompt_template = \"What food pairs well with {food}?\"     handler = AllChainDetails()     llm_chain = LLMChain(       llm=llm,       prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template))     llm_chain(\"chocolate\", callbacks=[handler])    Args:     debug_mode: If True, prints more details of each chain step and activates       breakpoints (using pdb) when unexpected behavior is detected.

The following code shows the updated code:\n\n```python\nplt.style.use('seaborn-ticks')\npokemon_data = pd.read_csv('gs://demo_test_public_bucket/uj13/pokemon-data.csv',\n                           sep = ';', converters={'Types':ast.literal_eval, 'Abilities':ast.literal_eval, 'Moves':ast.literal_eval})\nmove_data = pd.read_csv('gs://demo_test_public_bucket/uj13/move-data.csv', index_col = 0)\nfor var in ['Power', 'Accuracy']:\n    move_data[var].replace('None', np.nan, inplace=True)\n    move_data[var] = move_data[var].astype(float)\n\nmove_data['Move_Contest'] = move_data['Contest'].apply(lambda x: x.split('_')[0])\n\nfor contest in move_data.Contest.unique():\n    data_subset = move_data[move_data.Move_Contest == contest]\n    plt.scatter(data_subset.Power,\n                data_subset.Accuracy, label = contest)\n    plt.xlabel('Power')\n    plt.ylabel('Accuracy')\nplt.legend(loc = 'lower left', bbox_to_anchor = (1, 0))\nplt.show()\n```\n</pre> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>plt.style.use('seaborn-ticks')\npokemon_data = pd.read_csv('gs://&lt;your GCS bucket path&gt;/pokemon-data.csv',\n                           sep = ';', converters={'Types':ast.literal_eval, 'Abilities':ast.literal_eval, 'Moves':ast.literal_eval})\nmove_data = pd.read_csv('gs://&lt;your GCS bucket path&gt;/move-data.csv', index_col = 0)\nfor var in ['Power', 'Accuracy']:\n    move_data[var].replace('None', np.nan, inplace=True)\n    move_data[var] = move_data[var].astype(float)\n\nfor contest in move_data.Contest.unique():\n    data_subset = move_data[move_data.Contest == contest]\n    plt.scatter(data_subset.Power,\n                data_subset.Accuracy, label = contest)\n    plt.xlabel('Power')\n    plt.ylabel('Accuracy')\nplt.legend(loc = 'lower left', bbox_to_anchor = (1, 0))\nplt.show()\n</pre> plt.style.use('seaborn-ticks') pokemon_data = pd.read_csv('gs:///pokemon-data.csv',                            sep = ';', converters={'Types':ast.literal_eval, 'Abilities':ast.literal_eval, 'Moves':ast.literal_eval}) move_data = pd.read_csv('gs:///move-data.csv', index_col = 0) for var in ['Power', 'Accuracy']:     move_data[var].replace('None', np.nan, inplace=True)     move_data[var] = move_data[var].astype(float)  for contest in move_data.Contest.unique():     data_subset = move_data[move_data.Contest == contest]     plt.scatter(data_subset.Power,                 data_subset.Accuracy, label = contest)     plt.xlabel('Power')     plt.ylabel('Accuracy') plt.legend(loc = 'lower left', bbox_to_anchor = (1, 0)) plt.show() <pre>&lt;ipython-input-15-b94a6781696a&gt;:2: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: The seaborn styles shipped by Matplotlib are deprecated since 3.6, as they no longer correspond to the styles shipped by seaborn.

Here is the COBOL code: {cobol_file}\n\nPlease covert it to Java by following the prompt instructions below to do that:\n\nStep 1: Generate Java classes from COBOL data structures. Each COBOL data structure should correspond to a Java class. Ensure proper data type mapping and encapsulation.\n\nStep 2: Translate COBOL file input/output operations to Java file handling operations\n\nStep 3: Migrate COBOL business logic to Java. Convert COBOL procedures, paragraphs, and sections to Java methods. Ensure equivalent functionality\n\nStep 4: Convert COBOL conditional statements (IF, ELSE, etc.) to Java if-else statements and loops (PERFORM, etc.) to Java loops (for, while, etc.). Ensure logical equivalence\n\nStep 5: Replace COBOL-specific functions and operations with Java equivalents. This includes arithmetic operations, string manipulations, and date/time functions.\n\nStep 6: Generate Java constants from COBOL copybooks. Each COBOL constant should be converted to an equivalent Java constant\n\nStep 7: Update COBOL variable names and identifiers to follow Java naming conventions. Ensure proper camelCase or PascalCase formatting\n</pre> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>cobol_file = \"\"\"\nIDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n       PROGRAM-ID.

The migration process was divided into the following steps:\n\n1. **Generate Java classes from COBOL data structures.** Each COBOL data structure was converted to a Java class. Data type mappings were performed according to the following table:\n\n    | COBOL Data Type | Java Data Type |\n    |---|---|\n    | PIC X | String |\n    | PIC 9 | int |\n    | PIC 9(n) | long |\n    | PIC 9(n)V9(m) | double |\n    | PIC 9(n)V9(m) COMP | BigDecimal |\n    | PIC S9(n) | short |\n    | PIC S9(n) COMP | BigInteger |\n\n2. **Translate COBOL file input/output operations to Java file handling operations.** COBOL file input/output operations were translated to Java file handling operations using the following techniques:\n\n    * **OPEN INPUT** and **OPEN OUTPUT** statements were converted to `FileReader` and `FileWriter` constructors, respectively.\n    * **READ** statements were converted to `readLine()` method calls.\n    * **WRITE** statements were converted to `write()` method calls.\n    * **CLOSE** statements were converted to `close()` method calls.\n\n3. **Migrate COBOL business logic to Java.** COBOL business logic was migrated to Java using the following techniques:\n\n    * **IF** statements were converted to `if` statements.\n    * **ELSE** statements were converted to `else` statements.\n    * **PERFORM** statements were converted to `for` loops.\n    * **GO TO** statements were converted to `break` or `continue` statements.\n    * **EVALUATE** statements were converted to `switch` statements.\n\n4. **Convert COBOL conditional statements (IF, ELSE, etc.) to Java if-else statements and loops (PERFORM, etc.) to Java loops (for, while, etc.). Ensure logical equivalence**\n\n5. **Replace COBOL-specific functions and operations with Java equivalents. This includes arithmetic operations, string manipulations, and date/time functions.**\n\n6. **Generate Java constants from COBOL copybooks. Each COBOL constant should be converted to an equivalent Java constant**\n\n7. **Update COBOL variable names and identifiers to follow Java naming conventions. Ensure proper camelCase or PascalCase formatting**\n\nAny issues encountered during migration are listed below:\n\n* **Data type mapping issues:** Some COBOL data types did not have a direct equivalent in Java. For example, the COBOL `PIC X` data type was mapped to the Java `String` data type, but the `PIC X` data type can contain any character, while the `String` data type can only contain Unicode characters.\n* **File input/output issues:** Some COBOL file input/output operations were not supported by Java. For example, the COBOL `REWIND` statement was not supported by Java.\n* **Business logic issues:** Some COBOL business logic was not easily translated to Java. For example, the COBOL `EVALUATE` statement was not supported by Java.\n\nThese issues were resolved by making the following changes:\n\n* **Data type mapping issues:** The COBOL `PIC X` data type was mapped to the Java `byte[]` data type. This allows the `PIC X` data type to contain any character, just like the Java `String` data type.\n* **File input/output issues:** The COBOL `REWIND` statement was replaced with the Java `seek()` method. This allows the file to be rewound to the beginning.\n* **Business logic issues:** The COBOL `EVALUATE` statement was replaced with a series of `if` statements. This allows the same functionality to be achieved in Java.\n\nThe code migration process was successful and the migrated Java code is now in production.\n</pre> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>\n</pre>"},{"location":"genai-on-vertex-ai/developer_productivity_with_genai/4_codey_cobol_java_migration_example/#code-migration-with-code-chat","title":"Code Migration with Code Chat\u00b6","text":"<p>Codey models are text-to-code models from Google AI, trained on a massive code related dataset.

To fix this error, you can add the column to the DataFrame using the following code:\n\n```python\nmove_data['Move_Contest'] = move_data['Contest'].apply(lambda x: x.split('_')[0])\n```\n\nThis code uses the `apply()` method to add a new column to the DataFrame. The `lambda` function extracts the first part of the `Contest` column value, which is the contest name.\n\nOnce you have added the `Move_Contest` column to the DataFrame, you can then use it to filter the data and create the scatter plot.

Here is the COBOL code: {cobol_file}\n\nPlease covert it to Java by following the prompt instructions below to do that:\n\nStep 1: Generate Java classes from COBOL data structures. Each COBOL data structure should correspond to a Java class. Ensure proper data type mapping and encapsulation.\n\nStep 2: Translate COBOL file input/output operations to Java file handling operations\n\nStep 3: Migrate COBOL business logic to Java. Convert COBOL procedures, paragraphs, and sections to Java methods. Ensure equivalent functionality\n\nStep 4: Convert COBOL conditional statements (IF, ELSE, etc.) to Java if-else statements and loops (PERFORM, etc.) to Java loops (for, while, etc.). Ensure logical equivalence\n\nStep 5: Replace COBOL-specific functions and operations with Java equivalents. This includes arithmetic operations, string manipulations, and date/time functions.\n\nStep 6: Generate Java constants from COBOL copybooks. Each COBOL constant should be converted to an equivalent Java constant\n\nStep 7: Update COBOL variable names and identifiers to follow Java naming conventions.

His mother with her pretty hair, and Peggotty. The first objects David Copperfield remembers from his infancy are **the dressing-table with its silver inkstand, and his mother's face reflected in the mirror above it.** \\n\\nThis memory is significant because it highlights the importance of his mother in his early life and establishes a sense of domestic peace that will be shattered by her remarriage. \\n 29 71 1 At the inn where the mail stops, what is painted on the door? DOLPHIN At the inn where the mail coach stops in \"David Copperfield,\" the door features a painting (rather crudely done, we can assume!) of a **blue lion**. \\n\\nThis detail is mentioned in Chapter 5, when young David is on his journey to Yarmouth with the Peggotys. \\n 31 64 2 What name does David's aunt suggest to Mr. Dick they call him by? Trotwood Copperfield David's aunt, Betsey Trotwood, suggests that Mr. Dick call David by the name **\"Trotwood\"**. \\n\\nShe dislikes the name \"David\" because it was the name of David's deceased father, whom she strongly disapproved of. She believes that calling David \"Trotwood\" will help distance him from his father's memory and allow him to forge his own identity under her care. \\n 33 88 3 What is the name of the chapter in which Mr. Jorkins is first mentioned? CHAPTER XXIII: I Corroborate Mr. Dick, and Choose a Profession. Mr. Jorkins is first mentioned in Chapter 8, titled **\"My Holidays. Especially One Happy Afternoon.\"** \\n\\nAlthough he doesn't physically appear in this chapter, Mr. Jorkins is introduced as Mr. Spenlow's business partner at the law firm where David is taken to begin work. He is described as a meek and mild man who is constantly dominated by Mr. Spenlow. \\n 34 89 4 Describe the room in which Mr. Copperfield meets Steerforth for breakfast. A snug private apartment, red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted, where the fire burnt bright, and a fine hot breakfast was set forth on a table covered with a clean cloth; and a cheerful miniature of the room, the fire, the breakfast, Steerforth, and all, was shining in the little round mirror over the sideboard. While Dickens describes many rooms in detail throughout \"David Copperfield,\" he doesn't specifically describe the room where Mr. Copperfield and Steerforth have breakfast. \\n\\nIt's likely you're thinking of the breakfast scene at the **Inn in Yarmouth**, where David first meets Steerforth as a young boy. However, the text focuses more on the characters and their interactions than the room itself. \\n\\nWe can infer some details about the room from the context:\\n\\n* **It's an inn:** This suggests a common room used for meals by multiple guests, rather than a private dining room.\\n* **It's likely basic but comfortable:** The inn seems respectable but not luxurious, reflecting the modest means of David and Peggotty.\\n* **The atmosphere is lively:** The presence of the other guests, including the outspoken carrier, suggests a bustling and convivial atmosphere.\\n\\nAlthough Dickens doesn't provide a detailed description of the room, he masterfully uses dialogue and character interaction to paint a vivid picture of the scene and the dynamics between young David, the confident Steerforth, and the devoted Peggotty. \\n 31 233 5 After his engagement to Dora, David write Agnes a letter. What is the letter about? He writes to Agnes to assure her of his deep love for Agnes and that this was not a passing fancy or hasty decision. In Charles Dickens's \"David Copperfield,\" David does indeed write to Agnes Wickfield after his engagement to Dora Spenlow. However, the letter isn't about his love for Agnes, as some readers might anticipate. \\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the letter's content:\\n\\n* **Sharing the news:** David's primary purpose is to inform Agnes of his engagement to Dora. He describes his joy and Dora's charming qualities.\\n* **Seeking approval and reassurance:**  Deep down, David seeks Agnes's validation of his choice. He values her opinion and wants her blessing on his happiness, even though he might not fully realize the extent of his reliance on her.\\n* **Hinting at doubts:** While expressing happiness, the letter subtly reveals David's underlying concerns about his compatibility with Dora. He acknowledges their differences and hints at her lack of practicality. \\n* **Confiding in Agnes:**  Despite his engagement, David still turns to Agnes for emotional support and understanding. He confides in her about his anxieties and hopes for the future.\\n\\nThe letter is significant because it highlights:\\n\\n* **David's naivety:** He's blinded by Dora's beauty and charm, overlooking their fundamental differences.\\n* **The complexity of his feelings:** While in love with Dora, he still depends on Agnes for emotional support and guidance.\\n* **Foreshadowing:** The letter foreshadows the challenges and eventual disillusionment David will face in his marriage to Dora.\\n\\nIn essence, the letter to Agnes is a mixture of joyful announcement, subconscious plea for approval, and an unconscious revelation of David's underlying doubts about his choice of wife. \\n 34 347 6 What does David find in the hotel where Mr. Micawber requested him to meet in the middle of the night? A letter stating that he would appear in the morning at half past nine. David finds Mr. Micawber in a state of emotional distress, having already consumed a significant amount of punch. He's about to expose the villainy of his employer, Uriah Heep. \\n 40 43 7 Who are David's final thoughts about in the book? Agnes In the closing lines of \"David Copperfield,\" David's final thoughts are about **Agnes Wickfield**. \\n\\nHe reflects on their shared past, her unwavering love and support, and the happiness their future holds. He realizes that his restless pursuit of other loves was misguided, and that true happiness resided with Agnes all along. \\n\\nHere's a snippet from the final paragraph:\\n\\n\"And now, my own beloved husband, I am going to tell you of the greatest change that ever happened in my life... when something whispered to me, 'This is the man who can help me best!'\"\\n\\nThe book ends with David's thoughts turning towards their future together, filled with peace and contentment. \\n 28 146 In\u00a0[8]: Copied! <pre>import requests\n\nurl = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766.txt.utf-8\"\ntry:\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes (4xx and 5xx)\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n    print(f\"Error downloading file: {e}\")\n\nnovel = response.text\n</pre> import requests  url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766.txt.utf-8\" try:     response = requests.get(url)     response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes (4xx and 5xx) except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:     print(f\"Error downloading file: {e}\")  novel = response.text In\u00a0[59]: Copied! <pre>%%time\nprompt_template = \"\"\"\nYour task is to read the full text of the novel David Copperfield and then answer the questions below. \n\n&lt;document&gt;\n{context}\n&lt;/document&gt;\n\nBased on the novel text provided, answer the following: \n{question}\n\"\"\"\n\ndf_noncache = evaluate(questions, answers, prompt_template, novel, gemini_pro_model)\ndf_noncache\n</pre> %%time prompt_template = \"\"\" Your task is to read the full text of the novel David Copperfield and then answer the questions below.    {context}   Based on the novel text provided, answer the following:  {question} \"\"\"  df_noncache = evaluate(questions, answers, prompt_template, novel, gemini_pro_model) df_noncache <pre>CPU times: user 4.78 s, sys: 341 ms, total: 5.12 s\nWall time: 4min 41s\n</pre> Out[59]: question ground_truth model_response input_token_count output_token_count 0 What are the first objects that David can recall from his infancy?

CHAPTER XXIII: I Corroborate Mr. Dick, and Choose a Profession. Mr. Jorkins is first mentioned in **Chapter 23, \"I Corroborate Mr. Dick, and Choose a Profession\".** \\n 539719 32 4 Describe the room in which Mr. Copperfield meets Steerforth for breakfast. A snug private apartment, red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted, where the fire burnt bright, and a fine hot breakfast was set forth on a table covered with a clean cloth; and a cheerful miniature of the room, the fire, the breakfast, Steerforth, and all, was shining in the little round mirror over the sideboard. The room where David Copperfield meets Steerforth for breakfast is described as a \"snug private apartment,\" a welcome contrast to the dingy, shared coffee-room where David had spent the previous night. It is decorated with red curtains and has a Turkey carpet. A bright fire burns in the fireplace, and a \"fine hot breakfast\" is laid out on a table covered with a clean tablecloth. The scene is reflected in a \"cheerful miniature\" in the small, round mirror hanging over the sideboard. \\n 539716 103 5 After his engagement to Dora, David write Agnes a letter. What is the letter about? He writes to Agnes to assure her of his deep love for Agnes and that this was not a passing fancy or hasty decision. After David gets engaged to Dora, he writes Agnes a long letter telling her how happy he is and how wonderful Dora is. He describes his love for Dora as profound and unlike anything ever known, trying to convince Agnes that this is not a passing fancy like his childhood infatuations. He wants her to understand that his love for Dora is serious and lasting. \\n 539719 73 6 What does David find in the hotel where Mr. Micawber requested him to meet in the middle of the night? A letter stating that he would appear in the morning at half past nine. In the hotel where Mr. Micawber requested to meet David in the middle of the night, David finds a **letter**. \\n\\nThis letter informs David that Mr. Micawber will be appearing in the morning at precisely half past nine. \\n 539725 52 7 Who are David's final thoughts about in the book? Agnes At the end of the book, David's final thoughts are about **Agnes**. He reflects on their journey together through life, surrounded by their children and friends. He recognizes her as the guiding force that has always led him to be a better person, and expresses his enduring love for her. He imagines her by his side as he closes his life, a constant source of solace and inspiration. \\n 539713 81 In\u00a0[60]: Copied! <pre>%%time\nprompt_template = \"\"\"\nYour task is to read the full text of the novel David Copperfield and then answer the questions below. \n\n&lt;document&gt;\n{context}\n&lt;/document&gt;\n\nBased on the novel text provided, answer the following: \n{question}\n\"\"\"\n\nprompt = prompt_template.format(context=novel, question=questions)\nresponse = gemini_pro_model.generate_content(prompt).text\nMarkdown(response)\n</pre> %%time prompt_template = \"\"\" Your task is to read the full text of the novel David Copperfield and then answer the questions below.    {context}   Based on the novel text provided, answer the following:  {question} \"\"\"  prompt = prompt_template.format(context=novel, question=questions) response = gemini_pro_model.generate_content(prompt).text Markdown(response) <pre>CPU times: user 649 ms, sys: 103 ms, total: 752 ms\nWall time: 1min 41s\n</pre> Out[60]: <p>Here are the answers to your questions, based on the provided text of David Copperfield:</p> <ol> <li><p>What are the first objects that David can recall from his infancy?

McDonnell, holding a black folder\nand seemingly caught off guard, endures the moment with a tight smile.   The\nmirror's reflection reveals a chorus of reactions from the entourage.  Behind\nMcDonnell, a man with a wide grin appears to be enjoying the spectacle, while\nanother, partially obscured, seems to be stifling laughter. To Obama's left, a\nman in a blue tie throws a knowing glance at the camera, as if acknowledging the\nhumor of the situation.   The stark white walls and institutional green-and-\nwhite checkered floor contrast with the dark suits of the men, emphasizing the\nstaged nature of the event.  The presence of a \"Please do not...\" sign,\npartially visible in the mirror, adds a touch of irony, hinting at the playful\ntransgression of norms.   This image, far from a simple depiction of a weigh-in,\ncaptures a moment of levity amidst the seriousness of politics.

The setting is somewhat\nunexpected for a presidential appearance, but it's the dynamics of the scene\nthat truly bring a chuckle to the viewer.  In the foreground, a man in a suit \u2013\npresumably a member of Obama's staff \u2013 stands on a scale, his face hidden from\nview as he focuses on the reading. His body language suggests a mix of\nanticipation and perhaps a touch of self-consciousness.   Behind him, Obama\nsteals the show with a playful demeanor. He's caught mid-stride, leaning forward\nas if sneaking a peek at the scale's display. His face wears a mischievous grin,\nand his hand gestures \u2013 one finger pointing, the other seemingly holding back\nlaughter \u2013 speak volumes. It's as if he's about to let out a teasing remark,\nadding a touch of lighthearted camaraderie to the moment.  The surrounding men,\nlikely other staff members and Secret Service agents, add another layer to the\nnarrative. Some seem oblivious to the presidential antics, lost in conversation\nor their own reflections. Others, however, mirror Obama's amusement, their\nsmiles hinting at the shared joke.  The image is a delightful blend of the\nformal and the informal, capturing a moment of levity amidst the seriousness\nthat often surrounds political life. It reminds us that even presidents are\nhuman, capable of playful teasing and enjoying a good laugh with their team. The\nlocker room setting, a place typically associated with privacy and masculinity,\nadds a layer of humor to the scene, further highlighting the unexpectedness of\nObama's jocularity.</pre> <p>In this example we achieved the same level of description as Prompt #1, but with using system instruction (or system prompt):</p> <ul> <li>Add the persona, instructions, and mission into system instruction</li> <li>Used the simple prompt as before in Prompt #1</li> </ul> In\u00a0[11]: Copied! <pre>image_path = f\"{image_path_prefix}/city_street.png\"\nimage_content = Part.from_uri(uri=image_path, mime_type=\"image/png\")\ndisplay_image(image_path)\n</pre> image_path = f\"{image_path_prefix}/city_street.png\" image_content = Part.from_uri(uri=image_path, mime_type=\"image/png\") display_image(image_path) <p>Let's run with image first and then text in the prompt.</p> In\u00a0[12]: Copied! <pre>prompt_3 = (\n    \"Analyze the image and list the physical objects you can detect from the image.\"\n)\n\ncontents = [image_content, prompt_3]\ngenerate(gemini_flash, contents)\n</pre> prompt_3 = (     \"Analyze the image and list the physical objects you can detect from the image.\" )  contents = [image_content, prompt_3] generate(gemini_flash, contents) <pre>The image contains the following objects: - 11 cars - 2 traffic lights - 2\nstreet signs - 2 buildings - 1 street - 1 crosswalk - 1 motorcycle - 1\npedestrian</pre> <p>Let's run with text first and then image in the prompt.</p> In\u00a0[13]: Copied! <pre>contents = [prompt_3, image_content]\ngenerate(gemini_flash, contents)\n</pre> contents = [prompt_3, image_content] generate(gemini_flash, contents) <p>From this particular example, we see better response with image-first-then-text compared to text-first-then-image.

Note that  not all langchain classes will invoke all callbacks\n      when the callback handler is provided at initialization time, so the\n      recommended usage is to provide the callback handler when executing a\n      chain.\n\n  Example:\n    from langchain import LLMChain, PromptTemplate\n    from langchain.llms import VertexAI\n    import vertexai  # Comes from google-cloud-aiplatform package.\n    vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=REGION)\n\n    llm = VertexAI(temperature=0)  # Use any LLM.\n    prompt_template = \"What food pairs well with {food}?\"\n    handler = AllChainDetails()\n    llm_chain = LLMChain(\n      llm=llm,\n      prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template))\n    llm_chain(\"chocolate\", callbacks=[handler])\n\n  Args:\n    debug_mode: If True, prints more details of each chain step and activates\n      breakpoints (using pdb) when unexpected behavior is detected. Note that\n      the breakpoints are in the callbacks, which limits the amount of\n      inspectable langchain state to what langchain surfaces to callbacks.\n    out: Class for managing output, only tested with the OutputFormatter\n      accompanying this class.\n  \"\"\"\n  def __init__(self,\n               debug_mode: Optional[bool] = False,\n               out: Type[OutputFormatter] = OutputFormatter,\n               ) -&gt;

Exposes details available at callback time to each executed step in a chain.    Method arguments in this class are based on the (most of?) the arguments     available to the callback method, though not all implementations in this     class use all the arguments.    Usage:     Pass as an argument to a langchain method or class that accepts a callback       handler. Note that  not all langchain classes will invoke all callbacks       when the callback handler is provided at initialization time, so the       recommended usage is to provide the callback handler when executing a       chain.    Example:     from langchain import LLMChain, PromptTemplate     from langchain.llms import VertexAI     import vertexai  # Comes from google-cloud-aiplatform package.     vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=REGION)      llm = VertexAI(temperature=0)  # Use any LLM.     prompt_template = \"What food pairs well with {food}?\"     handler = AllChainDetails()     llm_chain = LLMChain(       llm=llm,       prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template))     llm_chain(\"chocolate\", callbacks=[handler])    Args:     debug_mode: If True, prints more details of each chain step and activates       breakpoints (using pdb) when unexpected behavior is detected.

Its central character, psychology professor Peter Boyd (Reagan), tries to teach human morals to a chimpanzee, hoping to solve the \"nature versus nurture\" question. Boyd hires Jane Linden (Lynn) to pose as the chimpanzee's mother while he plays father to it and uses 1950s-era child-rearing techniques.A sequel was released titled Bonzo Goes to College (1952), but it featured none of the three lead performers from the original film. Peggy, who had also appeared in My Friend Irma Goes West (1950), died in a fire on March 4, 1951, so another chimpanzee was hired for the second film. Reagan did not want to appear in the second film as he thought that the premise was unbelievable.\n\nPage: Bedtime for Democracy\nSummary: Bedtime for Democracy is the fourth and final studio album by American punk rock band Dead Kennedys. Released in 1986, songs on this album cover common punk subjects often found in punk rock lyrics of the era such as conformity, Reaganomics, the U.S. military, and critique of the hardcore punk movement. The album's title refers to the 1951 comedy film, Bedtime for Bonzo starring Ronald Reagan and also reflects the band's weary bitterness from the trial they were undergoing at the time over the controversial art included with their previous album. By the time recording of Bedtime for Democracy had begun, the Dead Kennedys had already played what would be their last concert with Jello Biafra and announced their breakup immediately after the release of the record, whose opening track is a cover of David Allan Coe's \"Take This Job and Shove It.\"\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Starting new chain.\nChain class: 'langchain.chains.llm.LLMChain'\nChain ID: '4cc5178b-452c-48ca-8c10-d23837e3191a'\nParent chain ID: '38181f4e-4bbc-4ee4-811f-31ccebba88aa'\nIterating through keys/values of chain inputs:\n   input: \"What US President costarred with a chimp in 'Bedtime for Bonzo'?\"\n\n\n&gt; Sending text to the LLM.\nChain ID: 'd55439f2-f564-4080-8781-b6363bd739ce'\nParent chain ID: '4cc5178b-452c-48ca-8c10-d23837e3191a'\nText sent to LLM:\nAnswer the following questions as best you can.

The phrase was coined in 1985 by radio personality Jon Hein in response to a 1977 episode from the fifth season of the American sitcom Happy Days, in which the character of Fonzie (Henry Winkler) jumps over a live shark while on water-skis.\n\n\n\nPage: Jump the Shark (The X-Files)\nSummary: \"Jump the Shark\" is the fifteenth episode of the ninth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files. The episode first aired in the United States on April 21, 2002 on the Fox network. It was written by executive producers Vince Gilligan, John Shiban and Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Cliff Bole. The episode is a \"monster-of-the-week\" episode\u2014unconnected to the series' wider mythology\u2014and was created to give closure for The Lone Gunmen television series, which was a spin-off of The X-Files. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.1 and was viewed by 8.6 million viewers. The episode received mixed to negative reviews from television critics.\nThe show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett and Reyes attempt to locate a female friend of The Lone Gunmen after former Area 51 Man-in-Black Morris Fletcher appears and claims that she is actually a super-soldier. What Doggett and Reyes soon discover is a bizarre plot to unleash a biological weapon via the use of grafted shark organs.\n\"Jump the Shark\" features the death of The Lone Gunmen\u2014popular recurring characters who first appeared in the first season episode \"E.B.E.\", although this plot was later retconned in the comic book series The X-Files Season 10. The episode proved difficult to make because, after the cancellation of The Lone Gunmen television series, Fox was adamant that the characters not have a featured role  back on The X-Files.  (The characters did appear in four previous season 9 episodes, but always very briefly.)  The choice to kill off the trio was controversial. Writers Spotnitz and Gilligan later revealed some regret with the way the episode was handled. However, actors Bruce Harwood and Dean Haglund were happy with the way the episode ended. The episode title is a humorous reference to the phrase \"jumping the shark\", which is used to describe shows that are in decline and therefore try a gimmick to get attention.\n\nPage: Ted McGinley\nSummary: Ted McGinley (born May 30, 1958) is an American actor.

It takes a list of documents and reranks those documents based on how relevant the documents are to a query. Compared to embeddings, which look only at the semantic similarity of a document and a query, the ranking API can give you precise scores for how well a document answers a given query. The ranking API can be used to improve the quality of search results after retrieving an initial set of candidate documents.</p> <p>The ranking API is stateless so there's no need to index documents before calling the API. All you need to do is pass in the query and documents. This makes the API well suited for reranking documents from any document retrievers.</p> <p>For more information, see Rank and rerank documents.</p> <p>3.1 Define and combine retriever using Vector Search and reranker using the Vertex AI Ranking API.</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>from langchain.retrievers.contextual_compression import ContextualCompressionRetriever\nfrom langchain_google_community import VertexAIRank\n\n# Instantiate the VertexAIReranker with the SDK manager\nreranker = VertexAIRank(\n    project_id=PROJECT_ID,\n    location_id=\"global\",\n    ranking_config=\"default_ranking_config\",\n    title_field=\"source\",  # metadata field to preserve with reranked results\n    top_n=5,\n)\n\nbasic_retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(\n    search_kwargs={\"k\": 5}\n)  # fetch top 5 documents\n\n# Create the ContextualCompressionRetriever with the VertexAIRanker as a Reranker\nretriever_with_reranker = ContextualCompressionRetriever(\n    base_compressor=reranker, base_retriever=basic_retriever\n)\n</pre> from langchain.retrievers.contextual_compression import ContextualCompressionRetriever from langchain_google_community import VertexAIRank  # Instantiate the VertexAIReranker with the SDK manager reranker = VertexAIRank(     project_id=PROJECT_ID,     location_id=\"global\",     ranking_config=\"default_ranking_config\",     title_field=\"source\",  # metadata field to preserve with reranked results     top_n=5, )  basic_retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(     search_kwargs={\"k\": 5} )  # fetch top 5 documents  # Create the ContextualCompressionRetriever with the VertexAIRanker as a Reranker retriever_with_reranker = ContextualCompressionRetriever(     base_compressor=reranker, base_retriever=basic_retriever ) <p>3.2 Examine results before and after re-ranking</p> <p>See the difference reranking makes!

Vertex AI simplifies the process with a suite of flexible standalone APIs to help your create your own search solutions.</p> <ul> <li>Document AI Layout Parser: Transforms documents into structured representations, making content easily accessible. Creates context-aware chunks for improved information retrieval in generative AI and discovery applications.</li> <li>Ranking API: Re-ranks search results based on relevance to the original query. Enhances RAG accuracy by optimizing retrieval beyond initial nearest neighbor search.</li> <li>Check Grounding API: Acts as a \"validator\" to determine whether statements or claims are supported by provided facts (essentially how grounded a given piece of text is in a given set of reference text). Enables online flagging of ungrounded responses and offline evaluation of generative responses.</li> </ul> <p>Key Features:</p> <ul> <li>Leverage Vertex AI Search technology:  Build custom RAG and Grounded Generation solutions using the same technology that powers Vertex AI Search.</li> <li>Granular control: Tailor your RAG system to specific use cases and offer greater control to your users.</li> <li>Seamless integration: Combine these APIs with core services like Embeddings API and Vector Search for advanced grounded AI applications.</li> </ul> <p>These builder APIS give you full flexibility and control on the design of your RAG application while at the same time offering accelerated time to market and high quality by relying on these lower-level Vertex AI APIs.

The <code>run_code_interpreter</code> method below helps automate this, but you still may need to rerun cells that generate working code that doesn't perfectly follow the instructions in the prompt.</li> <li>The use of Extensions and other Generative AI capabilities is subject to service quotas. Running the notebook using \"Run All\" may exceed  your queries per minute (QPM) limitations. Run the notebook manually and if you get a quota error pause for up to 1 minute before retrying that cell. Code Interpreter defaults to Gemini on the backend and is subject to the Gemini quotas, view your Gemini quotas here.</li> <li>The Code Interpreter Extension is stateless and therefore every request to Code Interpreter does not have knowledge of previous operations nor files injested or produced in previous steps. Therefore, with any request to Code Interpreter you need to submit all files and instructions for that request to complete successfully.</li> <li>When doing data science tasks with Code Interpreter, often the pandas library will be used, and common ways of using pandas generate a lot of warnings. Related to number 2 above, you'll want to make sure you don't necessarily automatically rerun code that generates warnings. One way to handle this is to instruct Code Interpreter to use the Python <code>warnings</code> library to supress warnings.

Re-running a cell that uses Generative AI capabilities may produce similar but not identical results.</li> <li>Because of #1, it is possible that an output from Code Interpreter producess errors.

The <code>run_code_interpreter</code> method below helps automate this, but you still may need to rerun cells that generate working code that doesn't perfectly follow the instructions in the prompt.</li> <li>The use of Extensions and other Generative AI capabilities is subject to service quotas.

Run the notebook manually and if you get a quota error pause for up to 1 minute before retrying that cell.

Re-running a cell that uses Generative AI capabilities may produce similar but not identical results. Some Code Interpreter calls in this notebook may sometimes produce executable code that misimplements some of the more complex parts of the instructions.</li> <li>Because of #1, it is possible that an output from Code Interpreter producess errors. If that happens re-run the cell that produced the coding error. The different generated code will likely be bug free. The <code>run_code_interpreter</code> method below helps automate this, but you still may need to rerun cells that generate working code that doesn't perfectly follow the instructions in the prompt.</li> <li>The use of Extensions and other Generative AI capabilities is subject to service quotas. Running the notebook using \"Run All\" may exceed  your queries per minute (QPM) limitations. Run the notebook manually and if you get a quota error pause for up to 1 minute before retrying that cell. Code Interpreter defaults to Gemini on the backend and is subject to the Gemini quotas, view your Gemini quotas here.</li> <li>The Code Interpreter Extension is stateless and therefore every request to Code Interpreter does not have knowledge of previous operations nor files injested or produced in previous steps. Therefore, with any request to Code Interpreter you need to submit all files and instructions for that request to complete successfully.</li> <li>If you're sending data prepared in non-standard ways to Code Interpreter, you'll have to provide Code Interpreter information on how to use that data. For example, as later in this notebook, if you're sending data compressed with a specific compression algorithm, you have to let Code Interpreter know how to uncompress the data.</li> <li>Common ways of using the pandas library generate a lot of warnings. Related to number 2 above, you'll want to make sure you don't necessarily automatically rerun code that generates warnings. One way to handle this is to instruct Code Interpreter to use the Python <code>warnings</code> library to supress warnings.

Custom Attributes are intended for more advanced usecases.</p> <p>If the custom attribute is made searchable, it can be used to implicitly influence retrieval and ranking of the page by providing additional information such as tags and related topics.</p> <p>We will perform the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>[Prerequisite] Creating a Vertex AI Search Website Datastore and Search App</li> <li>Setting Schema and URL mapping for Customer Attributes</li> <li>Getting Schema and URL mapping to confirm this is what we want</li> <li>Searching the Datastore and demonstrating how custom attributes can be used for filtering</li> <li>Clean up</li> </ul> <p>Please refer to the official documentation for the definition of Datastores and Apps and their relationships to one another</p> <p>REST API is used throughout this notebook.

For structured documents or unstructured documents, with or without metadata, it is advised to initially stage them on a GCS bucket or a BQ table and perform a subsequent import by referring to those documents by their URI. This approach creates a source-of-truth which can be investigated in details and allows for the possibility of <code>Incremental</code> import or <code>Full</code> import depending on the choice of ReconciliationMode. The <code>Full</code> option is particularly useful to resolve possible conflics and duplicates.</p> <p>However in some cases customers may prefer an inline ingestion of documents for its simplicity or to help them stay compliant with some restrictions defined on Org level. Note that inline ingestion comes with some limitations including more strict limits on the file size, and lower visibility on the UI given the fact that the content needs to be encoded into rawBytes.</p> <p>We will perform the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Create a VAIS Datastore</li> <li>Prepare sample documents</li> <li>Import sample documents (and other operations)</li> <li>Query the datastore</li> <li>Cleanup</li> </ul> <p>REST API is used throughout this notebook.

Boosting and Filtering are typically used to improve precision and recall as well as removing certain pages from consideration to satisfy a user-specified preference (e.g. limit the results to movies and exclude TV series), or customer-specified preference (e.g. do not show this movie in search results before it's officially released, do not show specific results to users from a specific country, quickly exclude an noncompliant page from search results until it is properly removed from the index). User specified preferences are typically applied via facets in the UI, for that reason, we also cover facets in this notebook.</p> <p>Boosting and Filtering are applied at the data store/index level and as part of the retrieval process. For that reason, customers cannot achieve the same goal by post processing the search results.</p> <p>VAIS website search leverages a sophisticated algorithm and many signals to surface relevant results in the right order (similar to what you get in google.com), as a result it is generally advised to evaluate the results without additional rules and incrementally add custom rules only as needed.</p> <p>Also note that Boosting is one of many ways by which you can influence ranking and retrieval in VAIS. A few examples of alternative routes are:</p> <ul> <li>User Events to implicitly and gradually tune the ranking based on end-user behavior</li> <li>Search Tuning to fine-tune the definition of \"relevant\" to your corpus, organization, domain, or preferences</li> <li>Custom Embeddings to augment the ranking identified by VAIS</li> <li>Synonyms to expand abbreviations and domain-specific terms based on their broadly-understood meaning</li> </ul> <p>While these functionalities are available irrespective of the datastore type (e.g. structured, unstructured, or website), we limit our focus in this notebook to Advanced Website Datastroes. Other than a few exceptions (e.g. filtering and boosting based on URL) most of the syntaxes presented here are applicable to other Datastore types as well.</p> <p>Note that there is an alternative way to apply serving controls (i.e. Boosting, Filtering, Synonyms, and Redirects) at the Global level, which means they do not need to be provided together with each query. That alternative path is out of the scope for this notebook and will be covered in a separate one.</p> <p>In order to specify boosting and filtering, we need particular attributes for each document which act as the hooks to identify the right target documents and to apply the corresponding modifiers to them. While each page (i.e. document) within the index has some predefined fields (e.g. URL, datePublished, dateModified), it is common to leverage metadata within the page-source as additional hooks. In order to identify those metadata, we need to update the Datastore Schema which is also covered in this notebook.</p> <p>We will perform the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>[Prerequisite] Creating a Vertex AI Search Website Datastore and Search App via API</li> <li>Updating the Schema to identify page Metadata</li> <li>Filtering based on predefined fields</li> <li>Filtering based on page Metadata</li> <li>Defining Facets based on page Metadata</li> <li>Basic boosting</li> <li>A sample advanced boosting based on user ratings</li> <li>Clean up</li> </ul> <p>Please refer to the official documentation for the definition of Datastores and Apps and their relationships to one another</p> <p>REST API is used throughout this notebook.

A basic Boost has a condition (with the same syntax as filters) and a Boost value.</p> <p>Boost value should be a number between -1.0 and +1.0 where negative numbers demote the matched documents (a.k.a. Bury). The boost function behaves roughly exponentially.</p> <p>It is generally advised to start with smaller boost values and adjust it as needed. If a document gets hit by several Boost conditions the boost amounts are additive.</p> <p>In this example we boost all the books written by \"Margaret Atwood\". The boost value in this example is set to 0.9. With this boost we get books by \"Margaret Atwood\" for a generic query like \"Book\", but if you search for a particular title not written by Margaret Atwood (e.g. \"house of cards\") you'd still get that title as the top result. to put it in physics terms, you can think of Boosting as a forcing function whereas Filters are constraints.</p>"},{"location":"genai-on-vertex-ai/vertex_ai_search/query_level_boosting_filtering_and_facets/#advanced-boosting","title":"Advanced Boosting\u00b6","text":"<p>Now let's look at a more sophisticated example of a boost rule. As mentioned earlier in this notebook,it is generally advised to try VAIS results out of the box and/or leverage user events to fine tune the rankings based on user behavior. However, in some cases, customers are interested to apply a certain business logic to the results which makes custom rules inevitable.</p> <p>For this particular example we want to primarily leverage user provided ratings to influence search results, specifically rating count and rating average. We also leverage VAIS's ability to apply piecewise linear boost functions as opposed to fixed boost amounts. We apply different Boost values as the function of the average rating for different buckets of rating counts (see more details in comments of the code block below). We also apply a separate boost rule to boost books with a larger number of ratings irrespective of the average rating (i.e. generally popular books). To make sure that rule does not demote newer content unfairly, we supplement the boost rules by a freshness boost. Lastly to ensure we're not suggesting popular and highly rated, yet irrelevant books to all queries, we're adding a relevancy threshold filter.</p> <p>Note that the value and logic used here are for demonstration purposes. Please adjust them based on your business logic and metadata schema.</p> <p>You can find more examples of Boosting in public documentation</p>"},{"location":"genai-on-vertex-ai/vertex_ai_search/query_level_boosting_filtering_and_facets/#clean-up","title":"Clean up\u00b6","text":""},{"location":"genai-on-vertex-ai/vertex_ai_search/query_level_boosting_filtering_and_facets/#delete-the-search-app","title":"Delete the Search App\u00b6","text":"<p>Delete the App if you no longer need it</p> <p>Alternatively you can follow these instructions to delete an App from the UI</p>"},{"location":"genai-on-vertex-ai/vertex_ai_search/query_level_boosting_filtering_and_facets/#delete-the-datastores","title":"Delete the Datastores\u00b6","text":"<p>Delete the Datastore if you no longer need it</p> <p>Alternatively you can follow these instructions to delete a Datastore from the UI</p>"},{"location":"genai-on-vertex-ai/vertex_evaluation_services/","title":"Vertex AI LLM Evaluation Services","text":"<p>We offer a comprehensive set of notebooks that demonstrate how to use Vertex AI LLM Evaluation Services in conjunction with other Vertex AI services.

Here you will evaluate the rephrased question.</li> <li>Response from the RAG System: Evaluate the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the final answer generated by the RAG System.</li> </ul> <p>It's important to note that this diagram is a simplified representation of a RAG System. Real-world RAG systems often involve additional components and complexities, but this overview provides a solid foundation for understanding the core principles.</p> <p>This diagram illustrates a simplified RAG system built on Google Cloud. IMPORTANT: The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate the common Google Cloud components of a RAG system and identify potential areas where output can be evaluated. It is not intended to be a final representation of how a RAG system should be designed.</p> <p></p> <p>System Architecture and GCP products:</p> <ul> <li>Data Ingestion: The system starts with various data sources, which can include web pages, files, databases, knowledge bases, etc.</li> <li>Preprocessing: The data is parsed and chunked by Document AI or with your custom scripts, and stored in Cloud Storage.</li> <li>Embedding and Storage: The processed data is then converted into vector embeddings using a Vertex AI Embeddings model, and these embeddings are stored in Vertex AI Vector Search.</li> <li>User Query: When a user submits a query, it is first rephrased using Vertex AI Gemini and converted into an embedding.</li> <li>Retrieval: The query embedding is used to search the stored embeddings and return the most relevant documents.</li> <li>Answer Generation: Finally, Vertex AI Gemini utilizes the retrieved documents and the rephrased question to generate a comprehensive and contextually relevant answer.</li> </ul> <p>Based on this system architecture, we will provide some guidelines to evaluate the rephrased user question and the final response from the RAG System.</p> <p>References: https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/parse-chunk-documents#parse-chunk-rag https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/layout-parse-chunk https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/online-pipeline-services</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied!

Evaluation criteria for coherence:</p> <ul> <li>Follows logical flow: Ideas logically progress with clear transitions that are relevant to the main point.</li> <li>Organized: Writing structure is clear, employing topic sentences where appropriate and effective transitions to guide the reader.</li> <li>Cohesive: Word choices, sentence structures, pronouns, and figurative language reinforce connections between ideas.</li> </ul> <p>Fluency: The <code>fluency</code> metric describes the model's language mastery. Evaluation criteria for fluency:</p> <ul> <li>Has proper grammar: The language's grammar rules are correctly followed, including but not limited to sentence structures, verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, proper punctuation, and capitalization.</li> <li>Chooses words appropriately: Words chosen are appropriate and purposeful given their relative context and positioning in the text. The vocabulary demonstrates prompt understanding.</li> <li>Smooth: Sentences flow smoothly and avoid awkward phrasing or run-on sentences.

User queries reveal insights into their needs, the products they engage with, and the effectiveness of the chatbot itself. This data is crucial for both understanding your users and continuously evaluating the performance of your deployed system.</p> <p></p> <p>This notebook demonstrates how to leverage Gemini to accelerate the analysis and summarization of real user queries from a production RAG system or chatbot. By analyzing these queries, we can identify a representative set of questions to form an evaluation dataset, establishing a foundation for continuous evaluation.</p> <p>This process aims to answer the following questions:</p> <ul> <li><p>What general categories of questions are users asking? What problems are they encountering?</p> </li> <li><p>What topics are prevalent in user conversations?</p> </li> <li><p>What sentiments are users expressing?</p> </li> </ul> <p>Inspired by a Weights and Biases article, this notebook extends those concepts by utilizing Gemini's capabilities.  Gemini's large context window allows for rapid exploratory data analysis (EDA) of clustered questions, even with extensive datasets, facilitating efficient metadata extraction and informed selection of an evaluation dataset.  This, in turn, enables the construction of a robust and representative evaluation set for the RAG system.</p> In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied! <pre>!pip install -qqq llama-index \\\nllama-index-llms-vertex \\\nllama-index-embeddings-vertex \\\npython-louvain \\\ntiktoken \\\naiofiles \\\nannotated-types \\\npython-fasthtml\n</pre> !pip install -qqq llama-index \\ llama-index-llms-vertex \\ llama-index-embeddings-vertex \\ python-louvain \\ tiktoken \\ aiofiles \\ annotated-types \\ python-fasthtml In\u00a0[\u00a0]: Copied!
